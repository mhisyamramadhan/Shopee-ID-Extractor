# Project Description
One of my tasks in my job is to gather Shopee product links from the Shopee platform into Google Spreadsheet. Then, I need to separate the Shop ID and Product ID numbers from those links. However, there's a challenge because these links have various patterns, making it difficult to split in Google Spreadsheet. This project was undertaken with the aim of simplifying this technical aspect of my work.

The project built with React JS and Tailwind CSS. Project's purpose is to automatically extract the Shop ID and Product ID numbers from Shopee product links with different patterns, such as:

Link Pattern 1: https://shopee.co.id/Link-Live-i.534165604.21065197866?sp_atk=993d65fe-367c-4829-b94f-140e2ffe82c5&xptdk=993d65fe-367c-4829-b94f-140e2ffe82c5

Link Pattern 2: https://shopee.co.id/product/534165604/21065197866

Link Pattern 3: https://shopee.co.id/xx-i.534165604.21065197866

By automating this process, it enables faster extraction and separation of Shop ID and Product ID data in Google Spreadsheet when working with Shopee product links. So far, this project only focuses on extracting Shop ID and Product ID numbers from Shopee product links exclusively. I have also deployed this project to Netlify, and you can see it below:

I have also included a video tutorial on how to use it in this repository.

Please feel free to share any feedback or suggestions you may have regarding my project. I am always open to learning and improving, and I greatly appreciate your input. Thank you for taking the time to review my work!
